# Aquafall

Aquafall is an operating system developed for the web using Svelte. It provides a modern, user-friendly experience and is born from the ashes of the ArcOS project, which has recently announced its shutdown.

## Background

Aquafall was created as a new vision after the discontinuation of ArcOS. While ArcOS made significant strides in web-based operating systems, its closure opened the door for Aquafall to build upon its legacy and create something innovative.

## Features

- Built with Svelte for a responsive and dynamic web experience.
- Delivers a modern operating system experience entirely in the browser.
- Continuously evolving with new features and improvements.
